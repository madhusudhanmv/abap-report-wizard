ABAP Report Wizard was presented in the SAPTechEd 2007 in Las Vegas as a community project.

Started back in the SDN Day Las Vegas 2006, the concept of using ABAP Wizards to automate code generation has evolved from a concept to a ready to use tool.

This project was created to coordinate all the activities related to further enhancements of this application.
